# Software Specification: <Project Title>

A frozen specification follows this six-section shape (mirroring the reference project's
spec). Once accepted, it is a contract — diverging implementation requires updating the
spec in the same PR or adding an ADR that supersedes the relevant section.

## 1. Objective & Business Context

What problem does this solve, for whom, and what pain (latency, fragmentation, cost,
correctness, risk) does it remove? State the business motivation, not the solution.

## 2. Functional Requirements

The observable behaviors, in measurable/testable phrasing. Prefer "O(1) allocation",
"p99 < 5 ms", "exactly-once delivery" over adjectives. Each requirement should map to a
mechanical check in the verification strategy (§6).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance, memory, portability, security, dependency policy, compatibility guarantees,
no-leak / no-UB / no-race promises — and the **scalability/load vocabulary** where it applies:
throughput (req/s), concurrent users/sessions, p50/p99 latency, saturation point, capacity
headroom, cold-start. A **hard** budget is a **number with its unit and direction** ("p99 ≤ 5 ms",
"≥ 60 fps", "cold-start ≤ 2 s", "heap ≤ 256 MB") — never an adjective; state how each number is
measured (§6 verification) so a violation is mechanical, not argued.

## 4. Logical Architecture & Core Algorithm

The central data structure or control flow, as prose plus a diagram block. This section
seeds the first design ADRs.

## 5. Public Interface

The functions / types / endpoints consumers depend on, with the error model. Be precise
about signatures, ownership, and failure behavior — this is the surface SemVer protects.

## 6. Verification & Test Strategy

How each requirement is *proven*: unit tests, sanitizers / type-checkers / race-detectors,
property tests, fuzzing, the canonical leak/race check, and (if perf-relevant) the
benchmark methodology. For every requirement in §2–§3, state how CI mechanically proves a
violation.
