# GitHub Repository Setup

The one-time, repo-level configuration that cannot live as a committed file — branch
protection, rulesets, merge strategy, Discussions, Pages, labels, the first milestone. Run
these once, with admin rights, after creating the GitHub repository for `pgs-eadros`.
Everything here reproduces the reference project's GitHub governance; the in-repo automation
(CI, Dependabot, issue forms, CODEOWNERS, release draft) ships as files and needs no setup.

> Prerequisites: the [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) CLI, authenticated (`gh auth login`),
> and `OWNER=danielPoloWork` / `REPO=pgs-eadros` exported.

```bash
OWNER=danielPoloWork
REPO=pgs-eadros
BRANCH=master
```

## 1. Merge strategy — squash only, PR title/body as the commit

```bash
gh api -X PATCH repos/$OWNER/$REPO \
  -F allow_squash_merge=true -F allow_merge_commit=false -F allow_rebase_merge=false \
  -F delete_branch_on_merge=true \
  -F squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE -F squash_merge_commit_message=PR_BODY
```

This is why the PR title/body is written "as it should read in `git log` forever"
(AGENTS.md §6.4).

## 2. Labels (one type-label per PR)

> **Run this before the first Dependabot run.** GitHub drops a label a bot requests if it does not
> exist yet — **silently**, with no error anywhere. `.github/dependabot.yml` asks for `ci` / `build`,
> which live in `.github/labels.yml` and only exist once this import has run; until then the first
> batch of bot PRs arrives unlabelled and nothing tells you why (#350).

```bash
# Requires yq. Imports .github/labels.yml idempotently.
yq -o=json '.[]' .github/labels.yml | jq -c . | while read -r l; do
  name=$(jq -r .name <<<"$l"); color=$(jq -r .color <<<"$l"); desc=$(jq -r .description <<<"$l")
  gh label create "$name" --color "$color" --description "$desc" --force
done
```

## 3. Branch protection / ruleset for `master`

Require PRs, a green CI, linear history, and conversation resolution; block direct pushes and
force-pushes. (Agents never push to the default branch — this enforces it server-side.)

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/$OWNER/$REPO/branches/$BRANCH/protection \
  --input - <<JSON
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["consistency / lint"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": { "required_approving_review_count": 0 },
  "required_linear_history": true,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false,
  "required_conversation_resolution": true,
  "restrictions": null
}
JSON
```

Add the build matrix contexts (e.g. `build / ubuntu-24.04 / …`) to `contexts` once you have
seen their exact names in the first CI run.

## 4. Discussions, Pages, and the security policy

```bash
# Enable Discussions (questions/ideas; linked from the issue chooser).
gh api -X PATCH repos/$OWNER/$REPO -F has_discussions=true

# GitHub Pages from the docs/ folder on the default branch (optional doc site).
gh api -X POST repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pages \
  -F "source[branch]=$BRANCH" -F "source[path]=/docs" 2>/dev/null \
  || echo "Pages already configured or needs the web UI once."
```

Private vulnerability reporting (the SECURITY.md target) is enabled in the web UI:
**Settings → Code security → Private vulnerability reporting → Enable**.

## 5. Roadmap milestones — seed every `MN — name`

PRs are delivered against the **roadmap milestones** (AGENTS.md §6.4), so seed **all** of them
from [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) up front — the board is then complete before milestone-scoped
delivery begins. Each is titled `MN — <name>` (em-dash, matching the `## Milestone N — <name>`
headers) with a professional description from the milestone's Goal.

```bash
# One POST per roadmap milestone — worked example for Milestone 1:
gh api -X POST repos/$OWNER/$REPO/milestones \
  -f title="M1 — Project bootstrap & CI" -f state=open \
  -f description="The thinnest slice that compiles, tests, and ships under the full quality bar."
```

To generate the create-commands for **every** milestone straight from `ROADMAP.md`, the EADOS
factory ships a helper (available in the in-place model): `python
.eados-core/tools/seed_milestones.py ROADMAP.md` prints the exact `gh api` calls — add `--run` to
execute them. Creating a milestone that already exists returns HTTP 422, so the seeder is
safely re-runnable.

## Re-running

Every command here is idempotent or safely re-runnable. Re-run after changing labels, after a
new CI check name should become required, or when onboarding a second collaborator (then bump
`required_approving_review_count` to 1 and add reviewers to CODEOWNERS).
