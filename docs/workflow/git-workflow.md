# Git Workflow

Full conventions for branches, commits, and pull requests on `pgs-eadros`. The short
version is in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §6; this document expands it with examples.

## 1. Boundary between agent and human

Agents are trusted to: create/switch branches; stage, commit, and push to feature branches;
draft PR titles and bodies; run `gh pr create --draft` only when explicitly authorized.

Agents must **never**: push directly to `master`; force-push it; merge or
squash-merge a PR (`gh pr merge`, `git merge` into `master`); skip hooks
(`--no-verify`) or signing unless explicitly asked; delete branches the user did not ask to
delete. The human reviews and merges. When in doubt, push the branch and ask.

## 2. Branch naming

`<type>/<short-kebab-description>`, `type ∈ {feat, fix, refactor, perf, docs, test, build,
chore, ci}`. Lowercase kebab, ≤40 chars, describe the *what* not the issue number.

## 3. Commit messages — Conventional Commits

```text
<type>(<scope>): <imperative subject ≤72 chars>

<body — explain WHY, wrap at ~72 cols>

<optional footers: BREAKING CHANGE: ... | Refs: ADR-XXXX | Refs: #NN>
```

- `scope` is a short subsystem noun. Scopes for this repo: `miner` `gate` `angle` `copywriter` `reviewer` `queue` `scheduler` `publisher` `channels` `metrics` `kb` `store` `events` `cli` `build` `tests` `docs` `ci` .
- One logical change per commit; imperative subject; the body adds the *why*.
- Rebase/squash before opening the PR if intermediate commits are noisy.

The same rules live as data in [`git-policy.yaml`](git-policy.yaml), so a check can read **this**
project's contract rather than someone else's. Verify a commit before you push:

```bash
python .eados-core/tools/git_check.py --advisory
```

Adding a subsystem means adding its scope in **both** places — here (and `AGENTS.md` §6) for the
reader, and `git-policy.yaml` for the check.

## 4. Pull Requests

### 4.1 Title & body — the squash-merge commit

Squash is the only merge method, so **the PR title and body become the commit that lands on
`master` forever** (the repo is configured to take the PR title/body as the squash
message — see [`github-setup.md`](github-setup.md) §1). Write them accordingly:

- **Subject** = the lead commit's Conventional-Commit one-liner (`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`,
  ≤72 chars). This is the PR title.
- **Body** = a verbose, professional summary — **never** just the subject collapsed to one line.
  Follow [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), whose
  sections map straight into a good squash body: **what** changed and **why** (context /
  motivation), the meaningful **changes**, and how it was **verified**. Footers (`Refs:`,
  `BREAKING CHANGE:`, `Closes #NN`) belong at the end.

A one-line squash body is a defect: the permanent `git log` should explain the change without
opening the PR.

### 4.2 Metadata (every PR)

Every PR carries complete project-board metadata, **set on creation** (not merely referenced in
the body). The assignee is the repository **owner** (`danielPoloWork`), never `@me` — `@me` resolves
to whichever actor (human or agent) runs `gh`, which is wrong when an agent drafts the PR.

- `--assignee danielPoloWork` — the owner
- `--label <type>` — exactly **one** type label matching the lead commit's `type`
- `--milestone "MN — name"` — the current open roadmap milestone (seeded from `ROADMAP.md`,
  [`github-setup.md`](github-setup.md) §5)
- `--project "<name>"` — the GitHub **Project**, where the repo has one

These are distinct from the body cross-links (§4.1): the body *references* the RFC and milestone
item for traceability; the flags above *set* the GitHub fields.

### 4.3 Drafting flow

1. Branch off `master`.
2. Make changes; commit in logical units.
3. `python tools/consistency_lint.py` — must pass.
4. Push; prepare the PR body. If authorized, draft it **with the metadata flags**:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --draft \
     --title "<type>(<scope>): <subject>" --body-file <body.md> \
     --assignee danielPoloWork --label <type> --milestone "MN — name"
     # --project "<name>"   # add when the repo has a Project
   ```

   Otherwise print the proposed command and wait.
5. **Stop.** The user opens the PR and merges manually.

### 4.4 Responding to review

Address comments with new commits on the same branch; avoid `--amend` on pushed commits.
Squash only when the user requests it. After merge, the user deletes the branch.

## 5. Repository hygiene

- Extend `.gitignore` rather than committing generated files.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or local toolchain paths.
- Large binary fixtures do not belong in the repo without prior agreement.
